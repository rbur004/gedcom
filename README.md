## DESCRIPTION:

A Ruby GEDCOM text file parser and producer, that produces a tree of objects from each of the
GEDCOM file types and subtypes. Understands the full GEDCOM 5.5 grammar, and will handle 
unknown tags hierarchies as a Note class.
 
 
## FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Gedcom multicharacter ANSEL encoding is currently not understood when reading and writing, but is preserved if the file is opened as ASCII-8BIT.
* CR line termination causes issues for systems with native LF line termination (CRLF is fine).
* Dates are currently just strings, but I want to parse these and test their validatity. 
  This is not as easy as it may seem at first, as dates may be in many formats, 
  they may be partial, or may actually be strings describing the date. 
* For my own use, I bend the GEDCOM 5.5 standard by allowing the reading of the following types in non-standard ways. 
  These will not affect the reading and writing of valid GEDCOM 5.5.
* * 'NOTE' type to appear in places it is not defined to exist in GEDCOM.
           This is necessary in order to be able to convert user defined tags into NOTE records.
* * 'RESN' type to appear in places it is not defined to exist in GEDCOM.
           I wanted to be able to mark any record as restricted.
* * 'SUBM' type to appear in 'EVEN' records.
           I wanted to be able to track where I got the event information from.
* * 'SEX' type to appear multiple times in an 'INDI' record,
          as a person's sex can now be changed.
* * 'SEX' type to allow more than 'M', 'F' and 'U',  
          to allow for the XXY, XXXY and X and other genetic anomolies associated with gender.
* * 'NAME' type allows event details ( eg 'DATE') , 
           as names changes are events, not just an attribute.
* * 'ADDR' type allows a 'TYPE' entry 
           to qualify what the address is for (e.g. home, work, ...) .
* User defined tags are converted to the NOTE type, with sublevels being CONT lines.
  These are recognised as any tag starting with '_'. 
* Haven't yet merged in the code to pretty print a family tree.
* Want to add a merge option, to take multiple transmission and make a single one from them.
* save/load (to/from a database) is yet to be ported. GedcomBase#to_db is a dummy function.

## SYNOPSIS:

	require 'gedcom'

	puts "parse TGC551LF.ged"
	g = Gedcom.file("../test_data/TGC551LF.ged", "r:ASCII-8BIT") #OK with LF line endings.
	g.transmissions[0].summary
	g.transmissions[0].self_check #validate the gedcom file just loaded, printing errors found.
	puts 

	puts "parse TGC55CLF.ged"
	g.file("../test_data/TGC55CLF.ged", "r:ASCII-8BIT") #Ok with CR LF line endings.
	g.transmissions[1].summary #Prints numbers of each level 1 record type found.
	g.transmission[1].self_check #validate the gedcom file just loaded, printing errors found.

	#print the parsed file to see if it matches the source file.
	#Note CONT and CONC breaks may end up in different places
	#Note Order of TAGS at the same level may be different
	#Note User TAGS are output as Notes.
	File.open( "../test_data/TGC551LF.out", "w:ASCII-8BIT") do |file|
	  file.print g.transmissions[0].to_gedcom
	end
	File.open( "../test_data/TGC55CLF.out", "w:ASCII-8BIT") do |file|
	  file.print g.transmissions[1].to_gedcom
	end
	puts "\nComplete"
